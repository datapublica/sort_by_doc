Sort Results using another Document
===================================

Whenever you have a large set of documents, and you want your user to be able to search on a subset, you can use the [Term Filter](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.7/query-dsl-terms-filter.html).
However, sometimes you also want to have a sort order dependant on your user, without having to duplicate your documents.
This plugin enables you to define a mapping of document ids to scores, so that only documents present in the mapping are returned, and they are returned in the order given by the scores.
This kind of query also enables you to add your own search criterias to furthermore restrict the number of documents returned.


1. Build this plugin:

        mvn clean compile test package
